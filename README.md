# Machine Learning Competition: Mixed Data Regression 📊🔍

Welcome to my solution for the Machine Learning Competition! 🚀 

In this intriguing challenge, we dive into a dataset with a unique mix of data structures: numerical, categorical, DateTime, and text. The twist? The data remains anonymous, concealing the true nature of its features. Our mission? To crack the code and predict "y" in this regression problem.

## Problem Overview 🌟
#### Dataset Composition: 
The dataset encompasses diverse data types: numerical, categorical, datetime, and text.
#### Data Anonymity: 
Feature identities remain undisclosed, adding a layer of complexity to the task.
#### Task: 
It's a regression problem. Our goal is to predict "y" using the given features.
